Pandas

    pandas is a Python library providing data structures and data analysis tools.
    Think of it like Excel for Python, but WAY more powerful.
    It is designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.

Benefits

    Efficient storage and processing of data.
    Includes many built in functions for data transformation, aggregations, and plotting.
    Great for exploratory work.
    Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN)
    Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
    Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations
    Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
    Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
    Intuitive merging and joining data sets
    Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
    Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
    Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format
    Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.

Limitations

    It is a general purpose data analysis tool, and there is an inherent trade-off between flexibility and specificity.
    As such, there may be other tools that are faster for certain well-defined applications.
    For example, once you know your data inside-and-out, and have a robust pipeline, you can use numpy directly for computations.
