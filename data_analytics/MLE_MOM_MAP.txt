Method of Moments
	1) Assume a distribution (Poisson, Bernouli, Binomial, Gaussian)
	2) compute the relevant moments from the data (mean, variance ...)
	3) use the moments to calculate the appropriate parameters of the distribution, then plot it and see if it makes sense.
	
Maximum Likelihood Estimation
	1) Assume a distribution 
	2) Define the likelihood function
	3) choose the parameters that maximize the likelihood function
