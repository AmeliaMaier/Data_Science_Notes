PyMC3
    Intro:
	for python	
	a probabilistic programming package
	designed to match statistical language
	allows complex posterior distributions and models
	does not require in-depth knowledge of fitting algorithms
	for R: LaplacesDemon package
	for both R and Python: Stan
    Features:
	extendable with C, C++, Fortran or Cython
	multi-platform
		Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational inference and other algorithms.
    	Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.
    	Creates summaries including tables and plots.
    	Traces can be saved to the disk as plain text, SQLite or pandas dataframes.
    	Several convergence diagnostics and model checking methods are available.
    	Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.
    	MCMC loops can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.
