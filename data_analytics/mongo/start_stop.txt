  sudo service mongodb stop
  sudo mongod


Start mongod Processes

  By default, MongoDB stores data in the /data/db directory. On Windows, MongoDB stores data in C:\data\db. On all platforms, MongoDB listens for connections from clients on port 27017.

  To start MongoDB using all defaults, issue the following command at the system shell:

      mongod

Stop mongod Processes

  In a clean shutdown a mongod completes all pending operations, flushes all data to data files, and closes all data files. Other shutdowns are unclean and can compromise the validity of the data files.

  To ensure a clean shutdown, always shutdown mongod instances using one of the following methods:

Use shutdownServer()

  Shut down the mongod from the mongo shell using the db.shutdownServer() method as follows:

      use admin
      db.shutdownServer()

  Calling the same method from a init script accomplishes the same result.

  For systems with authorization enabled, users may only issue db.shutdownServer() when authenticated to the admin database or via the localhost interface on systems without authentication enabled.

  Use --shutdown

  From the Linux command line, shut down the mongod using the --shutdown option in the following command:

      mongod --shutdown
